    Animation using ggplot objects

    Parameters
    ----------
    plots : iterable
        ggplot objects that make up the the frames of the animation
    interval : number, optional
       Delay between frames in milliseconds. Defaults to 200.
    repeat_delay : number, optional
        If the animation in repeated, adds a delay in milliseconds
        before repeating the animation. Defaults to `None`.
    repeat : bool, optional
        Controls whether the animation should repeat when the sequence
        of frames is completed. Defaults to `True`.
    blit : bool, optional
        Controls whether blitting is used to optimize drawing. Defaults
        to `False`.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The plots should have the same `facet` and
       the facet should not have fixed x and y scales.
    2. The scales of all the plots should have the same limits. It is
       a good idea to create a scale (with limits) for each aesthetic
       and add them to all the plots.
    3. For plots with legends or any other features that are cutoff,
       use the :class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.subplots_adjust`
       themeable to create space for it.
