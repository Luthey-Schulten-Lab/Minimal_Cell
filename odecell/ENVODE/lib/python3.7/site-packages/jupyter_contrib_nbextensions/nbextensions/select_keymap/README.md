Select CodeMirror Keymap
=======

This extension lets you choose between the available CodeMirror keymaps: default, emacs, vim, and sublime.

There's a chance that this might cause key conflicts, especially with other extensions.

Most browsers consume some of the global keybindings like `Ctrl+n`. [The Menu Wizard add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3menu-wizard/) allows you to disable some of the global key shortcuts, thus passing the keys through to CodeMirror.
