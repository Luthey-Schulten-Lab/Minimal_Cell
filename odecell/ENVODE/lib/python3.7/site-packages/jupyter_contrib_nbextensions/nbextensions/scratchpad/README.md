# Scratchpad notebook extension

Adds a scratchpad cell to Jupyter notebook.
This is a cell in which you can execute code against the current kernel without modifying the notebook document.

Scratchpad cells can be executed using `Shift-Enter` (other shortcuts are appled to the notebook document). The scratchpad can be toggled by clicking the icon in the bottom-right, or via the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-B`.
