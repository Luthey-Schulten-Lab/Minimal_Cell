(some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter notebook
==============================================

This extension for Jupyter notebook enables the use of some LaTeX
commands and environments markdown cells.

1. **LaTeX commands and environments**

   -  support for some LaTeX commands within markdown cells, *e.g.*
      ``\textit``, ``\textbf``, ``\underline``.
   -  support for **theorems-like environments**, support for labels and
      cross references
   -  support for **lists**: *enumerate, itemize*,
   -  limited support for a **figure environment**,
   -  support for an environment *listing*,
   -  additional *textboxa* environment

2. **Citations and bibliography**

   -  support for ``\cite`` with creation of a References section

3. **Document-wide numbering of equations and environments, support for
   ``\label`` and ``\ref``**
4. **Configuration toolbar**
5. **LaTeX\_envs dropdown menu for a quick insertion of environments**
6. **User's LaTeX definitions** file can be loaded and used
7. **Export to plain HTML, Slides and LaTeX with a customized exporter**
8. Environments title/numbering can be customized by users in
   ``user_envs.json`` config file.
9. Styles can be customized in the ``latex_env.css`` stylesheet
10. **Autocompletion** for \$, (, {, [, for LaTeX commands and environments

More environments can be simply added in ``user_envs.json`` or in the
source file (``thmsInNb4.js``).

It is possible to export the notebooks to plain :math:`\LaTeX` and html
while keeping all the features of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension
in the converted version. We provide specialized exporters, pre and post
processors, templates. We also added entry-points to simplify the
conversion process. It is now as simple as

.. code:: bash

    jupyter nbconvert --to html_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb

or

.. code:: bash

    jupyter nbconvert --to latex_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb

to convert ``FILE.ipynb`` into html/latex while keeping all the features
of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension in the converted version. Other options are 
``slides_with_lenvs`` for converting to reveal-js presentations, and ``html_with_toclenvs`` to include a 
table of contents. The 
LaTeX converter also expose several conversion options (read the
`docs <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__).

Demo/documentation
------------------

The ``doc`` subdirectory that constains an example notebook and its html
and pdf versions. This serves as the documentation. A demo notebook
``latex_env_doc.ipynb`` is provided. Its html version is
`latex\_env\_doc.html <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__
serves as 
`documentation <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__.

Installation
------------

The extension consists of a pypi package that includes a javascript
notebook extension, along with python code for nbconvert support. Since
Jupyter 4.2, pypi is the recommended way to distribute nbextensions. The
extension can be installed

-  from the master version on the github repo (this will be always the
   most recent version)
-  via pip for the version hosted on Pypi
-  via conda, from the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.github.io/>`__
   `channel <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>`__
-  as part of the great
   `jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__
   collection. Follow the instructions there for installing. Once this
   is done, you can open a tab at ``http://localhost:8888/nbextensions``
   to enable and configure the various extensions.

From the github repo or from Pypi,

1. install the package

   -  ``pip3 install https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/archive/master.zip [--user][--upgrade]``
   -  or ``pip3 install jupyter_latex_envs [--user][--upgrade]``
   -  or clone the repo and install git clone
      https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter\_latex\_envs.git python3
      setup.py install

2. install the notebook extension

   ::

       jupyter nbextension install --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]

3. and enable it

   ::

       jupyter nbextension enable --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]

For Jupyter versions before 4.2, the situation after step 1 is more
tricky, since the ``--py`` option isn't available, so you will have to
find the location of the source files manually as follows (instructions
adapted from [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)'s
`jupyter\_highlight\_selected\_word <https://github.com/jcb91/jupyter_highlight_selected_word>`__).
Execute

::

    python -c "import os.path as p; from latex_envs import __file__ as f, _jupyter_nbextension_paths as n; print(p.normpath(p.join(p.dirname(f), n()[0]['src'])))"

Then, issue

::

    jupyter nbextension install <output source directory>
    jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs

where ``<output source directory>`` is the output of the first python
command.

Disclaimer, sources and acknowledgments
---------------------------------------

Originally, I used a piece of code from the nice online markdown editor
`stackedit <https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187>`__, where
the authors also considered the problem of incorporating LaTeX markup in
their markdown.

I also studied and used examples and code from
`ipython-contrib/jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__.


-  This is done in the hope it can be useful. However there are many
   impovements possible, in the code and in the documentation.
   **Contributions will be welcome and deeply appreciated.**
